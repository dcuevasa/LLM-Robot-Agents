This repository is home to the **LLM-Robot-Agents** (name still TBD? 🤔), where **robots and AI join forces** for a future of better, more interactive autonomy. 🚀  

This is the repository of my undergraduate Research Project/Thesis for the [FLAGlab Research Group](https://flaglab.github.io/) from 🐐 Universidad de los Andes 🐐 in Colombia

🦾 **What’s the goal?**  
Bringing together **robotics, AI, and LAA architectures** to develop an intelligent system that makes robots smarter, more adaptive, and ready to tackle real-world challenges.  

📌 **What’s inside?**  
- **Documentation 📖**: Everything you need to know about how this project works, including **Pepper, NAO, and Unitree G1** integrations.  
- **Code 🛠️**: The magic that powers our agents.  
- **Reports 📑**: Progress updates, findings, and analysis from our research journey.  

## 🌟 Project Highlights  
✨ **LAA Integration** – Making robots think smarter, not harder.  
✨ **Cooperative Agents** – Robots teaming up like never before.  
✨ **Code Generation** – Let AI write some of the code for us.
