# 📖 Documentation  

Welcome to the **Documentation** section of this project. This folder contains all the necessary information for understanding, implementing, and expanding the **LAA (Large Language Model-Augmented Autonomous Agent) Architecture** in social robots.  

Each subfolder includes documentation i found relevant (and remembered to store), and **Notes.md** files where personal insights and observations are stored.  

## 📂 Folder Structure  

### 🔹 Chosen_LAA  
- Documentation for the **LAA architecture selected** for this project.  
- Does NOT include explanations of its **design, implementation, and integration** into robotic platforms that can be found in its [Github Repository](https://github.com/Cooperative-IA/CooperativeGPT)  

### 🔹 Code_generation  
- Details on **code generation and execution** (Even outside of Robotics and LAA). 

### 🔹 Cooperative_Agents  
- Information on how multiple **autonomous agents** collaborate.  
- Focus on **multi-agent interactions and decision-making**.

### 🔹 Other_LAAs  
- Documentation on alternative **LAA architectures** explored.  
- Does Not include research comparisons.
- Looks at potential future integrations (or even a switch in Architecture)  

### 🔹 Reports  
- Contains **progress reports, final documentation, and analysis**.  
- Summaries of **results, evaluations, and insights** from testing.  

### 🔹 Robots

## 📝 Notes.md in Each Folder  
Each folder contains a **Notes.md** file for storing:  
- Observations during development.  
- Challenges encountered and solutions.  
- Ideas for improvement and expansion.
**THESE ARE NOT SERIOUS OR STRUCTURED NOTES. THESE ARE MOSTLY FOR MYSELF**  

This structure ensures **clarity, organization, and easy navigation** while working on the project. 🚀
