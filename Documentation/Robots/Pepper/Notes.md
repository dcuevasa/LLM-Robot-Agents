# Pepper Notes

I already have a lot of experience working with Pepper, so it is the least of my problems; I already set up the Simulation in Gazebo (though, it's missing integration with the full SinfonIA Stack):
- [robot info for simulation](https://github.com/dcuevasa/pepper_robot_noetic)
- [simulation](https://github.com/dcuevasa/pepper_virtual_noetic)

So far only issue is the robot trembles like crazy and it doesn't work properly with MoveIt! However the most relevant stuff is the perception (cameras) and navigation, which are both working fine

My current worries are in working with more than one robot.
